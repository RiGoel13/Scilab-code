# AM Modulation in Scilab

This project shows **Amplitude Modulation (AM)** implemented using Scilab, a feature-rich open-source numerical computation software. Simulation includes message and carrier signal generation, generation of the AM signal, and an **adaptive modulation index** based on message amplitude.

## What's Inside

- Generation of a **cosine message signal** and a **cosine carrier wave**
- Application of **standard AM modulation**
- **Adaptive modulation index** to accommodate varying amplitude of the message signal
- **Visualization** of the message, carrier, and modulated signals
- **Spectrogram analysis** of the AM signal

## Requirements

- [Scilab](https://www.scilab.org/) (any recent version)


## Output

- Plots for:
  - Message signal
  - Carrier signal
- AM modulated signal (with and without adaptive modulation)
- Spectrogram of the AM signal for time-frequency analysis

## How to Run

1. Open Scilab.
2. Copy and paste the script into the Scilab editor.
3. Run the script to visualize the signals and spectrogram.
