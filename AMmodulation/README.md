# AM Modulation


This project illustrates Amplitude Modulation (AM) with Scilab, a versatile open-source numerical computation tool. The simulation involves message and carrier signal generation, AM signal generation, and an adaptive modulation index to accommodate varying message signal amplitude.

What's Inside: 
1 Generation of a cosine message signal and a cosine carrier wave

2 Implementation of standard AM modulation

3 Adaptive modulation index to accommodate varying message signal amplitude

4 Visualization of the message, carrier, and modulated signals

5 Spectrogram analysis of the AM signal

Requirements: Scilab (any recent version)

Output
Plots for:
1 Message signal
2 Carrier signal

1 AM modulated signal (with and without adaptive modulation)
2 Spectrogram of the AM signal for time-frequency analysis

How to Run:
1 Open Scilab.
2 Copy and paste the script into the Scilab editor.
3 Run the script to view the signals and spectrogram.
